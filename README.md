# AngularPomodoro

AngularPomodoro is a simple Pomodoro timer built with Angular and the Angular
Material Component library.

By default, it follows the basic Pomodoro technique of a 25 minute work session
alternating with breaks. Short breaks are 5 minutes while long breaks are 15
minutes. A long break is awarded upon completion of every fourth work session.
Otherwise, a short break is taken.
