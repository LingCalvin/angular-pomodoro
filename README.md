# Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a simple Pomodoro timer. It helps you get work done by encouraging
focusing on a task for a set amount of time, then giving you a rest to recharge.
By alternating between work and breaks, you can maintain focus on a task for
longer without getting worn out.

By default, it follows the basic Pomodoro technique of a 25 minute work session
alternating with breaks. Short breaks are 5 minutes while long breaks are 15
minutes. A long break is awarded upon completion of every fourth work session.
Otherwise, a short break is taken.
